    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Sinigang is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savoury taste. It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine. In 2021, sinigang was rated as the world's best vegetable soup by TasteAtlas.</p>
<p>Sinigang typically use meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with tamarind, tomatoes, garlic, and onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (gabi adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth[10]), white radish (labanós), water spinach (kangkóng), yardlong beans (sitaw) and eggplant (talóng). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with green long peppers in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made miso.</p>
